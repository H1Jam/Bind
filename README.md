# UIduinoLibrary
UIduino is an Android UI toolkit for Arduino which allows you to create interactive UI elements for your Arduino codes. In other words, your MCU codes can spawn UI elements on the Android screen to show data (Text, Chart, Gaugages, etc ) or get user inputs back (Buttons, Checkbox, Joystick, Slider, etc). For example, you may create a button with custom text, size, and color, spawn it in the desired location on the Android app and register a callback function to run the commands when the user presses the button. You don't need to modify the Android app! everything happens inside the code you deploy into your Arduino board. For now, we only support Bluetooth.
Will be ready soon! Stay tuned...
