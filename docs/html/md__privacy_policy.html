<p>H.Jamshidi, the author of <a class="el" href="class_bind.html" title="The Bind class provides a framework for creating interactive applications with BindCanvas.">Bind</a> library and BindCanvas, built the BindCanvas app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by HJam at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>

</ul>
<p>I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to their Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.</p>
<p><b>Security</b></p>
<p>I do not collect any personal data thus their is no data transmission concern here. I value your trust, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet (or any other form of media), or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do the necessary actions.</p>
